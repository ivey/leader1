# Leader-1 - a Twitter bot framework for Go

This is Leader-1, the #1 framework for making Twitter bots in Go. It
is inspired by the work @mispy did on mispy/twitter_ebooks, although
it is not as heavily focused on Markov bots - yet.

# Installation

    $ go get github.com/ivey/leader1

# Example

For now, see the proto-iveybot in the bots directory.
